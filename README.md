# OMGRemote
Custom made omegle client

# What is this?
This app was created from a three day challenge to myself to build an android app over a weekend. The original idea for this app was to exploit vulnerbilities in Omegle's chat protocol (spy mode) to engage in MITM attacks. It would later be turned into a normal client to make it into the app store. With some modifications, it could still be used for that purpose.

Please note:
This is an old, archived project that is no longer maintained. Built in 2013.
